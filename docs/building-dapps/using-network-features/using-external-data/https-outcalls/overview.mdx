# What are HTTPS outcalls?

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Advanced", "Concept"]} />

Canisters can make a request to a URL using [HTTPS outcalls](https://internetcomputer.org/https-outcalls). HTTPS outcalls can be used to directly obtain off-chain data or interact with off-chain systems, such as Web 2.0 services or enterprise IT infrastructure.

HTTPS outcalls enable a wide range of applications. For example, oracle services can directly integrate with ICP in a trustless manner, and dapps can provide user notifications or anything else that requires communication with servers on the Internet.

Some examples of onchain oracle-like services that obtain data from off-chain sources through HTTP outcalls include the [EVM RPC canister](/docs/current/building-dapps/chain-fusion/ethereum/evm-rpc/overview), the [exchange rate canister](/docs/current/rosetta-defi/exchange-rate-canister/) or the [Orally dapp](https://kclew-uiaaa-aaaal-qbuiq-cai.ic0.app/sybil).

## How it works

For detailed information on how it works, please refer to the [HTTPS outcalls - How it works](/docs/current/references/https-outcalls-how-it-works).

## How to make a request

For detailed information on how to utilize this feature, please refer to the [HTTPS outcalls - How to use](/docs/current/building-dapps/using-network-features/using-external-data/https-outcalls/overview) page.

The documentation includes examples demonstrating how to make the following types of requests:
- [GET request](./https-outcalls-get.mdx)
- [POST request](./https-outcalls-post.mdx)

## Examples

Refer to the following examples of HTTPS outcalls implementations in canister smart contracts:

- Fetch price information for DeFi protocols using the [exchange rate canister](https://github.com/dfinity/exchange-rate-canister).
- Communicate with other chains using the [EVM RPC canister](https://github.com/internet-computer-protocol/evm-rpc-canister).
- Fetch information about Bitcoin Ordinals and Bitcoin Meta-Protocols using the [Ordinals canister](https://github.com/sardariuss/ordinals_canister).

# How to use HTTPS outcalls: Intro

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Advanced", "Concept"]} />

This feature allows smart contracts to directly make calls to HTTP(S) servers external to the blockchain and use the response in the further processing of the smart contract, without the need for oracles.

## Key concepts

### Methods supported

The feature currently supports `GET`, `HEAD`, and `POST` methods for HTTP requests.

### ICP management canister

In order for a canister to use HTTPS outcalls, it needs to call the system API of ICP. Canisters can call into the system API by sending messages to [the ICP management canister](/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec#ic-management-canister) using the identifier `"aaaaa-aa"`.

### Cycles

[Cycles](/docs/current/developer-education/developer-concepts/gas-cost) used to pay for the call must be explicitly transferred with the call. They are not deducted from the caller's balance implicitly.

## The API for sending HTTPS outcalls

As per the [Internet Computer interface specification](/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec), a canister can use the `http_request` method by [following specification](/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec#ic-http_request):

### The request
The following parameters should be supplied within the request:

-   `url`: The requested URL that must be valid according to [RFC-3986](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt) and its length must not exceed `8192`. The URL may specify a custom port number.

-   `max_response_bytes`: Optional; Specifies the maximal size of the response in bytes. If provided, the value must not exceed `2MB` (`2_000_000B`). The call will be charged based on this parameter. If not provided, the maximum of `2MB` will be used.

-   `method`: Currently, only `GET`, `HEAD`, and `POST` are supported.

-   `headers`: List of HTTP request headers and their corresponding values.

-   `body`: Optional; The content of the request's body.

-   `transform`: An optional function that transforms raw responses to [sanitized responses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_sanitization), and a byte-encoded context that is provided to the function upon invocation, along with the response to be sanitized. If provided, the calling canister itself must export this function.

### The response

The returned response (and the response provided to the `transform` function, if specified) contains the following fields:

-   `status`: The response status (e.g., 200, 404).

-   `headers`: List of HTTP response headers and their corresponding values.

-   `body`: The response's body.

## Sample code

Examples of making `GET` and `POST`requests in Motoko and Rust:

* [Minimal sample code of making a `GET` request](./https-outcalls-get.mdx).
* [Minimal sample code of making a `POST` request](./https-outcalls-post.mdx).
