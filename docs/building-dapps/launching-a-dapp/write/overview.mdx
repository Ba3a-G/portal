# Write

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "Concept"]} />

ICP supports a wide range of applications and architecture types.
Apps can range from a single canister to complex, multi-<GlossaryTooltip>canister</GlossaryTooltip> projects and everything in between.

You can begin writing and structuring your application using one of two primary workflows:

- **Standard workflow**: The developer writes both the frontend and backend code, then deploys both to ICP as canisters.

- **Framework-based workflow**: An external framework is used to help facilitate creating and deploying canisters. [Learn more about frameworks](#framework-based-workflow).

## Standard workflow

### Choosing the programming language for the backend

The backend stores the application’s data and contains the core logic.
Several languages are supported, such as:

- **[Rust](/docs/current/building-dapps/developer-tools/cdks/rust/)**: Supported by [DFINITY](https://github.com/dfinity/cdk-rs). Currently, Rust is the language with the most production coverage for ICP applications.
All system smart contracts, such as [the DAO governing ICP](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/tree/master/rs/nns), [the ICP ledger](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/tree/master/rs/ledger_suite/icp), and the [Bitcoin](https://github.com/dfinity/bitcoin-canister) and [Ethereum](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/tree/master/rs/ethereum) integration smart contracts, are written in Rust. This language gives the developer full control over all aspects of the smart contract, starting from performance to memory management.
The only disadvantage of Rust is that it is lower-level compared to other languages and requires more expert programming skills to write safe and secure code.
[Learn more about using Rust](/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/rust).

- **[Motoko](/docs/current/motoko/main/getting-started/motoko-introduction)**: Supported by [DFINITY](https://github.com/dfinity/motoko). Motoko is production-ready and was specifically designed to onboard developers onto ICP and leverage the actor-based programming model of ICP. It is a high-level language with a garbage collector and syntax that is similar to TypeScript.
Examples of production smart contracts that use Motoko include [ICDex](https://github.com/iclighthouse/ICDex) and [CycleOps](https://github.com/CycleOperators/cycles-manager).[Learn more about using Motoko](/docs/current/motoko/main/getting-started/motoko-introduction).

- **TypeScript (beta)**: Supported by [Demergent Labs](https://github.com/demergent-labs) under the name Azle. Azle is in beta. Please check [the Azle website](https://demergent-labs.github.io/azle/) for more information.

- **Python (beta)**: Supported by [Demergent Labs](https://github.com/demergent-labs) under the name Kybra. Kybra is in beta. Please check [the Kybra website](https://demergent-labs.github.io/kybra/kybra.html) for more information.

- **[C++](https://docs.icpp.world/)**: Supported through the [C++ CDK](https://docs.icpp.world/).

### Choosing a web framework for the frontend

The [HTTP Gateway protocol](/docs/current/references/http-gateway-protocol-spec) of ICP allows browsers to load web assets such as JS, HTML, and CSS from a canister via HTTP.
This means that [web assets can be stored fully onchain](/docs/current/developer-docs/web-apps/application-frontends/overview) and developers don’t need to use traditional centralized web hosting to serve the UI of their application.

[Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), [React](https://react.dev/), and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) have been used successfully in production. `dfx v0.17.0` and newer can be used to generate project templates that include one of these frameworks. [Learn more](/docs/current/developer-docs/web-apps/browser-js/js-frameworks).

The typical development workflow of the frontend is:

1. The developer writes frontend code such as HTML, JS, or CSS.
2. The developer configures their `dfx.json` file to include a frontend canister with type "assets".
3. The developer deploys the project. `dfx` will compile the frontend asset files into an asset canister.
4. Users open the application in the browser by navigating to the URL `https://<canister-id>.icp0.io` or a [custom domain](/docs/current/developer-docs/web-apps/custom-domains/using-custom-domains) if one has been registered for the canister.
5. The canister serves the web assets to the browser via its `http_request` endpoint that gets invoked for each HTTP request.
6. When the JS code runs in the browser, it can call the backend canister endpoints using the [ICP JavaScript agent](/docs/current/building-dapps/developer-tools/off-chain/agents/javascript-agent) library, which is analogous to `web3.js` and `ethers.js` of Ethereum.

#### Limitations
Server-side rendering (SSR) does not work in canisters because they require JS code that is not built into canisters.
In the future, this might become possible with Azle. Until then, if SSR is required, then one solution is to host the frontend outside of ICP while keeping the core logic in the backend canister.

Having no frontend at all is also a valid option for smart contracts that don’t have a UI and are callable only by users or other smart contracts.

### Creating a new project

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="prereq" label="Prerequisites" default>

<input type="checkbox"/> <a href="/docs/current/building-dapps/getting-started/install">Install the IC SDK.</a>
<div>
</div>
<input type="checkbox"/> Download and install an IDE or code editor. <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a> is recommended.

:::tip

For writing Motoko code, the [Motoko VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dfinity-foundation.vscode-motoko) is highly recommended for syntax highlighting.

:::

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Create a new project. When prompted, select your backend language and frontend framework of choice:

```bash
dfx new hello
```

The [`dfx new`](/docs/current/building-dapps/developer-tools/dfx/dfx-new) command creates a new project directory, template files, and a new `<project_name>` Git repository for your project.

:::tip
You can also obtain projects from other sources, such as [ICP Ninja](https://icp.ninja) or the [sample repository](https://github.com/dfinity/examples).
:::

:::caution
When creating new projects with `dfx new`, only alphanumeric characters and underscores should be used. This is to assure that project names are valid within Motoko, JavaScript, and other contexts.
:::

Navigate into your project directory:

```
cd hello
```

For projects created with `dfx new`, the project structure will resemble the following. If you are using an ICP Ninja project or other sample project, project structure may vary.

In this directory, the following files and directories are notable:

- `README.md`: The default README file to be used for documenting your project.
- `dfx.json`: The default ICP configuration file used to set configurable options for your project.
- `src/`: The source directory that contains all of your dapp's source files.
- `hello_backend`: The source directory that contains your dapp's backend code files.
- `hello_frontend`: The source directory that contains your dapp's frontend code files.

### Reviewing the default program code

Open the backend canister source code file in your code editor. The backend canister's code will be located in the `src/hello_backend` subdirectory. For projects created with `dfx new`, the default backend code will resemble the following. If you are using an ICP Ninja project or other sample project, program code will vary.
