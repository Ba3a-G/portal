# Construction API implementation

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Intermediate", "Tutorial" ]} />

The construction API allows for offline signing of transactions, then posting them on ICP at a later point in time. It is recommended to first go through [flow of operations](/docs/rosetta-defi/rosetta/icp_rosetta/construction_api/operations-flow) of the construction API to gain an understanding of how it works, what endpoints to call with what parameters, and where the user has to take action upon receiving certain responses.

In general the construction API of Rosetta supports three categories of transaction types:
- [Transferring assets](/docs/rosetta-defi/rosetta/icp_rosetta/construction_api/operations-flow): This is the most basic functionality. In accordance with the ICRC-1 standard you can use Rosetta to transfer ICP.
- [Staking and neuron management](/docs/rosetta-defi/rosetta/icp_rosetta/construction_api/staking): To be able to stake your ICP and earn rewards for taking part in the voting mechanism of the NNS you will need to create a neuron and configure it so it fits your personal preferences.
- [Voting and following](/docs/rosetta-defi/rosetta/icp_rosetta/construction_api/voting): To gain rewards in the form of maturity you will need to take part in the voting on the NNS or follow existing neurons.
