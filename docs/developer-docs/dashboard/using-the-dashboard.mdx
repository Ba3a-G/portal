## Overview

## Home

From the ICP dashboard home, you can view data that gives you a high-level overview of the entire network.

![ICP Dashboard](_attachments/dashboard_1.png)

Data shown on the homepage includes:

- A network map showing the geographic location of the network's nodes and boundary nodes.
- Number of node machines, boundary nodes, node providers, and subnets.
- Network power consumption.
- Real-time data for current transactions per second, blocks per second, and cycle burn rate.
- Number of canisters deployed and current collective size of canister state.
- Number of Internet Identities.
- Total ICP supply.
- Total ICP circulating supply.
- ICP transactions.
- Total ICP burned.
- ckBTC and ckETH total supply.
- Million instructions executed per second.
- Total number of NNS proposals.
- Total ICP staked in the Neurons' fund.
- Maturity of the Neurons' fund.
- Block finalization rate.
- Cycles conversion rate.

To view detailed information about different components of ICP, click on an embedded link on the homepage or navigate to a different page using the navigation menu.

## Governance

The [governance dashboard page](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/governance) displays detailed information about the Network Nervous System (NNS) that governs the network. From this page, you can learn more about:

- Number of neurons.
- Total voting power.
- Total daily voting rewards.
- Average voting power per neuron.
- Average daily voting rewards.
- Overall voting participation.
- Maturity modulation.
- NNS proposals.

### Voting rewards calculator

The governance page includes a voting rewards calculator that can be used to estimate the potential annualized return for a neuron. To use the calculator, slide the bar to input a different dissolve delay value. The minimum dissolve delay is 6 months and the maximum is 8 years.

### NNS proposals

The governance page will include a high-level overview of recent proposals, including their title, topic, status, and total number of votes. To view details about a specific proposal, click on the proposal's ID.

![ICP Dashboard Proposals](_attachments/dashboard_3.png)

Details of the proposal will include the proposal's summary, payload, date created, date executed, voting results, a list of the Known Neurons that voted, and a link to view the proposal on the NNS dapp.

## Neurons

The [neurons dashboard page](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/neurons) displays information about neurons currently staked on the network. ICP token holders can stake ICP into a neuron to receive voting power in the NNS. [Learn more about neurons](/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/nns/concepts/neurons/neuron-overview).

![ICP Dashboard Proposals](_attachments/dashboard_5.png)

Information on this page includes the total amount of ICP staked in all neurons, then includes separate graphs for the total amount staked in neurons that are not dissolving and the total amount staked in neurons that are dissolving. This page also provides an overview of all neurons, including their ID and name, state, voting power, and dissolve delay. To view detailed information on a neuron, click on its neuron ID from the overview.

Neuron details include:

- Voting history.
- Staked ICP.
- State.
- Age.
- Dissolve delay date.
- Dissolve delay bonus.
- Age bonus.
- If the neuron is a Genesis neuron.
- If the neuron is part of the Neurons' fund.
- Voting power.

## SNS

The 'SNS' tab on the dashboard allows you to view information about each of the Service Nervous Systems (SNSs) deployed on ICP. An SNS is a DAO deployed on ICP that uses the same architecture as the NNS. [Learn more about SNSs](/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/sns/overview). Select an SNS from the menu to view details about that DAO.

Details displayed about the SNS will include:

- SNS status.
- Token name.
- Token symbol.
- Total token supply.
- Transaction fee.
- Initial voting period.
- Max voting period.
- Proposal rejection cost.
- Minimum neuron stake.
- Minim dissolve delay.
- Maximum dissolve delay.
