# Peer-to-peer

The peer-to-peer (P2P) layer serves as the foundation of the Internet Computer’s protocol stack, enabling secure and reliable communication between nodes within a subnet. This layer allows nodes to broadcast messages, such as user inputs to canisters or protocol messages like block proposals. P2P guarantees that all messages are eventually delivered to the necessary nodes, supporting the asynchronous nature of real-world communication networks—a core assumption of the Internet Computer protocol.
