The SNS framework is a toolbox for creating DAOs that govern individual dapps. Both are open for everyone to participate and facilitate decentralized decision making. Tokenomics incentivise voting participation and ensure that DAO decisions are aligned with the long-term interests of the ICP and the governed dapps.",
